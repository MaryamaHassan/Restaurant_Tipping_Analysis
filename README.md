### Summary

This project offers an in-depth analysis of tipping behaviour at the restaurant, focusing on various factors influencing customer gratuity, including group size, total bill amounts, and smoking habits. The data indicates that weekends are the most popular times for dining, with Saturdays witnessing the highest customer traffic. Furthermore, larger groups tend to generate higher total bills and correspondingly larger tips, while non-smokers constitute the majority of the clientele. These insights provide a valuable foundation for developing targeted marketing strategies and enhancing the overall dining experience.

### Conclusion

Through a detailed analysis of the restaurant's tipping data, several key insights were revealed. Customers predominantly visit during weekends, with a preference for smaller group sizes (typically 2-4 people). There is a clear correlation between the size of the group and the tips givenâ€”the larger the group, the higher the tip, though there are some exceptions, particularly on Saturdays, where tips were lower despite larger group sizes.

Our analysis also showed that tips are strongly influenced by the total bill amount; higher bills generally result in larger tips. Additionally, a demographic trend emerged: non-smokers outnumber smokers among the restaurant's clientele. This data provides valuable insights into customer behaviour, helping the restaurant better understand tipping patterns and preferences, particularly regarding group size and visit timing.

The results of this study can be leveraged for operational improvements, such as targeted promotions on weekends or group discounts to incentivise larger group visits, which are likely to result in higher tips. Further analysis could explore other factors affecting tipping behaviour, such as the quality of service or seasonal variations in customer habits.
